Summary: Before taking any action based on adwords reports, are you looking at the statistical significance of the data?
Status: draft

For eg : Nabu has 3 campaigns running for his hotel. One fine day he sees the following AdWords report for the last
30 days

| Campaign | Clicks | Cost | Cost per Conversion | Conversions |
|----------|--------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Hotel 1  | 200    | 100  | 5                   | 20          |
| Hotel 2  | 300    | 180  | 6                   | 30          |
| Hotel 3  | 100    | 300  | 10                  | 10          |

`Hotel 1` and `Hotel 2` Campaigns are almost running at the same cost per conversion but `Hotel 3` is running at a cost per conversion 
which is much higher than the other 2. This usually means that there is good amount of improvement that can be done in reducing the cost 
per conversion of `Hotel 3` campaign. 

One word of caution here

>Never jump to a conclusion with statistically insignificant data.

Let me elaborate the same by changing the values of the report. The new report is as follows

| Campaign | Clicks | Cost | Cost per Conversion | Conversions |
|----------|--------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Hotel 1  | 200    | 100  | 5                   | 20          |
| Hotel 2  | 300    | 180  | 6                   | 30          |
| Hotel 3  | 50     | 20   | 10                  | 2           |

Here one cannot say with confidence that `Hotel 3` is not performing well because of the lack of statistical significance.
As a rule of thumb I look for campaigns with more than 10 conversions for any given period before coming to a conclusion. For 
campaigns with less than 10 conversions, it makes lot more sense to look at a longer time period. if you were looking at last 30 day,
have a look at last 90 days and see if the conversions is reaching 10.
